1. simple rowLog is being written using Eclipse, which is highly recommended. It is
a good idea to download the two jar files (see the README) and configure Eclipse to
use these since otherwise you'll have to download them again after every ant clean.
That said it isn't necessary to do a clean before commit, just make sure that the
bin, dist and lib directories and *.jar are excluded for svn.

2. At the moment the language files are being written in British English. They will
be checked before a release, so it doesn't matter if there are a few mistakes.
Other languages will also be added leading up to a first release. (English, German,
Polish are definite since the main developer can write them, possibly also French.)

3. The first release date is currently unknown. [Full Stop]...

4. If developing using a DOS based OS you might have problems reading various text
files lacking endings (this file included). Too bad.

5. simple rowLog is built using ant, some commmands are:
'ant clean' - cleans the working directory.
'ant build' - build a runnable copy.
'ant getdep-bin' -  get the necessary jar files for compiling / running.
'ant dist' - builds the distributable files. Remember to edit the version in
	     build.xml as to have correctly named files.
