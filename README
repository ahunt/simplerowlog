IMPORTANT: This is a pre-alpha release version of simple rowLog. Many functions
may not work, work incorrectly, or work properly. Test at your own risk.
Documentation is also lacking (or incorrect), as may become quickly apparent.

simple rowLog Readme:

1. Dependencies:
	simple rowLog requires Apache Derby, JCalendar and simple-log to function.
	The jar files derby.jar, jcal.har and simple-log.jar from the respective
	projects need to be available in the classpath when running simple rowLog,
	and are included in the default distribution. In the source distribution
	they can be found under src/external. More information can be found under
	NOTICE.
	
2. Administration:
	simple rowLog possesses a multiple account system for administration, where
	individual users can receive individual accounts, and also individual
	permissions. One user (but only one) always has to be the root user, i.e.
	has full permissions. User accounts are NOT linked to the members list used
	in the front end of the program. A log is kept of the users that have logged
	in to the administration backend.
		Obviously, to keep accounts and the computer secure, access to both the
	hardware, but also simple rowLogs files must be restricted. More on this can
	be found in the manual.
		To reset the whole of simple rowLog (fresh start) remove the files in
	the directory conf (but make sure conf/default is kept), and delete the
	contents of the directory database. If you simply want to reset the
	configuration of simple rowLog, but keep all data (note: admin users are
	also stored in the database, i.e. are part of the data), only delete the
	files within the directory conf (keeping the directory conf/default intact).
	Conversely, to delete the data, remove the contents of the folder directory.
		Note: if you have deleted the database directory, a wizard will start
	asking you to set up the default administration account.
		If you do forget the admin password, it is possible to reset it: this
	requires you to have full access to the computer, and the simple rowLog
	directory. Check the manual for details.
