simple rowLog TODO file.

------------------ [HIGH PRIORITY] ---------------------------------------------

-- Finish the db: implement deletion of items.

-- Change listeners in config panels where necessary, and then change the apply button.

-- All tables: add check to make sure a row is selected if using a button to modify.

-- Verify that the test classes AREN'T included in the ant jar command.

-- ErrorHandler for all the program, with a command line version implemented.

-- Check non 0 zero length in add/edit member dialogs and full length.

-- In OutingDialog warn what fields aren't filled in, and check first before submitting due to crash otherwise.

-- Language files system for when files aren't found. Also clean up locations.


------------------ [MEDIUM PRIORITY] -------------------------------------------
-- Admin error log for minor messages, e.g. MemberInfo.getName etc.

-- Update the error system, in the gui do the error catching and create an
    appropriate user friendly warning. Log all error at database level though.
    
-- Cache and cache checking in db, and in things like OutingDialog to check for
    last update.
    
-- Documentation: incorporate into packaging.

-- Auto backup tool for db and settings.

------------------ [LOW PRIORITY] ----------------------------------------------
-- In the database, for all getGroups etc, extract data directly from one request
    (instead of simply getting ids, then single groups).
    
-- Security log.
    
-- Error cleaning on opening of database.

-- Outingdialog: capability to directly add new members (with probability of name
    being a real name.).
    
-- Central localisation manager and interface for updateLocalisation(); Any
localisable classes register so that they are updated. Selector on main screen.

-- AboutDialog: tabbed pane for devs.

-- Date selection: add a pausable thread for the date selector, so that we only
update once the user has stopped changing the date.

-- Move the log config files.

-- Length of names in database: document, check, etc.

-- Update all file locations to get from config.

-- Create localisation gui tool.

-- AdminAuthenticationDialog: update waiting time for next attempts, and format
        the time in hours/minutes/seconds.
        
-- Tooltips

-- Boats: use the type in the name if there are multiple boats, and have shared
    key over the two columns. Check when making users and boats whether a
        similar one exists.
