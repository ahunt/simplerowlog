simple rowLog TODO file.

-- Finish the db.
	
-- Update the error system, in the gui do the error catching and create an
	appropriate user friendly warning. Log all error at database level though.
	

-- In the database, for all getGroups etc, extract data directly from one request
	(instead of simply getting ids, then single groups).
	
-- Cache and cache checking in db, and in things like OutingDialog to check for
	last update.
	
-- Error cleaning on opening of database.

-- Admin error log for minor messages, e.g. MemberInfo.getName etc.

-- Verify that the test classes AREN'T included in the ant jar command.

-- Outingdialog: capability to directly add new members (with probability of name
	being a real name.).
	
-- Central localisation manager and interface for updateLocalisation();

-- EntryAlreadyExistsException thrown where required.

-- AboutDialog: tabbed pane for devs.

-- Date selection: add a pausable thread for the date selector, so that we only
update once the user has stopped changing the date.

-- Move the log config files.
