simple rowLog TODO file.

------------------ [HIGH PRIORITY] ---------------------------------------------

-- Add in a delete button to the Modify* dialogs.

-- Finish the db: implement deletion of items, rearrange order as necessary.
(Done: Boat, Member)

-- Change listeners in config panels where necessary, and then change the apply button.

-- Verify that the test classes AREN'T included in the ant jar command.

-- ErrorHandler for all the program, with a command line version implemented.

-- Language files system for when files aren't found. Also clean up locations. (Add the default language files to the jar?)

-- Initial LAF: javax.swing.UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()
(Add initial configurator)

-- Create a way of listing the outings tables in the admin interface, and deleting them as appropriate.

-- Tooltips for info in the admin dialog.

------------------ [MEDIUM PRIORITY] -------------------------------------------
-- Admin error log for minor messages, e.g. MemberInfo.getName etc.

-- Update the error system, in the gui do the error catching and create an
    appropriate user friendly warning. Log all error at database level though.
    
-- Cache and cache checking in db, and in things like OutingDialog to check for
    last update.
    
-- Documentation: incorporate into packaging.

-- Auto backup tool for db and settings.

-- Logging of everything on the db.

------------------ [LOW PRIORITY] ----------------------------------------------
-- Tell the admin / person logging in if they have failed an attempt, by displaying
    a red text at the top of the dialog, similarly to kde unlock dialogs.

-- In the database, for all getGroups etc, extract data directly from one request
    (instead of simply getting ids, then single groups).
    
-- Security log.
    
-- Error cleaning on opening of database.

-- Outingdialog: capability to directly add new members (with probability of name
    being a real name.).
    
-- Central localisation manager and interface for updateLocalisation(); Any
localisable classes register so that they are updated. Selector on main screen.

-- AboutDialog: tabbed pane for devs.

-- Date selection: add a pausable thread for the date selector, so that we only
update once the user has stopped changing the date.

-- Move the log config files.

-- Length of names in database: document, check, etc.

-- Update all file locations to get from config.

-- Create localisation gui tool.

-- AdminAuthenticationDialog: update waiting time for next attempts, and format
        the time in hours/minutes/seconds.
        
-- Tooltips

-- Boats: use the type in the name if there are multiple boats, and have shared
    key over the two columns. Check when making users and boats whether a
        similar one exists.
        
-- Active LAF changing on request.
