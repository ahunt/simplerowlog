simple rowLog TODO file.

------------------ [HIGH PRIORITY] ---------------------------------------------

-- Finish the db.

-- Verify that the test classes AREN'T included in the ant jar command.

------------------ [MEDIUM PRIORITY] -------------------------------------------
-- Admin error log for minor messages, e.g. MemberInfo.getName etc.

-- Update the error system, in the gui do the error catching and create an
    appropriate user friendly warning. Log all error at database level though.
    
-- Cache and cache checking in db, and in things like OutingDialog to check for
    last update.
    
-- Documentation: incorporate into packaging.

-- Auto backup tool for db and settings.

------------------ [LOW PRIORITY] ----------------------------------------------
-- In the database, for all getGroups etc, extract data directly from one request
    (instead of simply getting ids, then single groups).
    
-- Security log.
    
-- Error cleaning on opening of database.

-- Outingdialog: capability to directly add new members (with probability of name
    being a real name.).
    
-- Central localisation manager and interface for updateLocalisation(); Any
localisable classes register so that they are updated.

-- AboutDialog: tabbed pane for devs.

-- Date selection: add a pausable thread for the date selector, so that we only
update once the user has stopped changing the date.

-- Move the log config files.

-- Length of names in database: document, check, etc.

-- Update all file locations to get from config.

-- Create localisation gui tool.

-- AdminAuthenticationDialog: update waiting time for next attempts, and format
        the time in hours/minutes/seconds.
