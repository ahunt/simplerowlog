\section{Administrator permissions}
    
    The following permissions can be granted to admins. By default none will be
    enabled. Note that whichever user is set as root is treated as having
    all permissions. Only the root admin can change which user is set as root.
    These exact names are used in the database, whereas the admin interface
    displays the below information.
    
    \begin{description}
        \item [config\_main] Whether or not the admin can access (and modify) the main configuration.
    
        \item [can\_do\_shutdown] Whether or not this admin is allowed to shutdown \srl. Note that this setting becomes irrelevant if exit-authentication is disabled.
        
        \item [admin\_list] Whether or not this admin can access the admins list.
        \begin{description}
            \item [admin\_list.details] Whether or not the details for an admin
                    can be viewed.
            \item [admin\_list.modify] Whether or not the details for an admin
                    can be modified. Note that the status of an admin as being
                    root or not is not covered by this rule, but requires the
                    modifying admin to be root.
        \end{description}
        
        \item [member\_list] Whether or not the admin is allowed to access the list of members. This automatically grants permission to add members.
        \begin{description}
            \item [member\_list.details] Whether or not the admin can view members's details.
            \item [member\_list.modify] Whether or not the admin can edit members. Note that this means the admin can also view member's details when editing them.
            \item [member\_list.remove] Whether or not the admin can remove members.
        \end{description}
        
        \item [group\_list] Whether or not this admin can access the group list. This automatically grants permission to add groups.
        \begin{description}
            \item [group\_list.modify] Whether or not the admin can edit the groups.
            \item [group\_list.remove] Whether or not the admin can remove groups.
        \end{description}
        
        \item [boat\_list] Whether or not this admin can access the boat list. This automatically grants permission to add boatss.

            \item [boat\_list.remove] Whether or not the admin can remove boats.
